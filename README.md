## 🌟 Overview

**Inside-Medium** is an AI-powered content recommendation engine designed to help readers find the most relevant and high-quality Medium articles based on their interests or selected articles. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Topic Modeling (NMF) techniques, the system extracts hidden topics from articles, encodes them into meaningful vectors, and uses cosine similarity to recommend similar content.

## 📚 Dataset - Medium Articles Dataset

📎 **Source**: [Medium Articles Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dorianlazar/medium-articles-dataset/data)

The **Medium Articles Dataset** is a curated collection of publicly available articles published on Medium.com. It contains both **textual content and engagement metadata**, making it ideal for tasks like recommendation systems, NLP, and content analysis.

#### 📁 Dataset Highlights:

* **Total Records**: \~8,000 articles
* **Key Columns**:

  * `title`: Title of the article
  * `subtitle`: Subtitle or secondary heading
  * `author`: Author of the article
  * `date`: Publication date
  * `claps`: Number of claps (engagement metric)
  * `reading_time`: Estimated reading time (in minutes)
  * `publication`: Name of the publication (if any)
  * `url`: Link to the original article
  * `article`: Full textual content of the article

#### ✅ Why This Dataset?

* Great for **topic modeling**, **text classification**, and **recommendation systems**
* Contains real-world engagement signals (`claps`) to enrich the model
* Useful for building **AI-driven content discovery platforms** like Inside-Medium

## 🔮 Future Work Roadmap

The *Inside-Medium* project can be extended significantly to offer a more personalized and intelligent content recommendation system. Here's a proposed roadmap structured in **three development phases**, each with an estimated time frame.

---

### 🚀 **Phase 1: UI & API Integration (1–2 Weeks)**

**Objective:** Transform the backend logic into a user-accessible application.

*  Build a clean and responsive frontend using **HTML/CSS/JS** for user interaction.
*  Deploy the article recommender as a **Flask API**, allowing input of article titles and displaying similar content.
*  Enable users to upload custom datasets (CSV) for analysis and recommendations.
*  Add search bar, loading indicators, and user-friendly error messages.

### 🧠 **Phase 2: Personalization & Topic Modeling (2–3 Weeks)**

**Objective:** Enhance the intelligence of the recommender.

*  Introduce **user profiles** to track reading history and provide personalized recommendations.
*  Apply **LDA or BERTopic** for better topic clustering and diversity in suggestions.
*  Integrate **claps, reading time, and tags** more deeply into the similarity scoring system.
*  Include feedback mechanism to rate recommended articles.

### 🧠 **Phase 3: Embedding Models & LLM Integration (3–4 Weeks)**

**Objective:** Upgrade the recommendation engine with deep learning and language models.

*  Replace TF-IDF + NMF with **sentence embeddings** using `SentenceTransformers` or Hugging Face models.
*  Use **vector databases (e.g., Qdrant, FAISS)** for faster and smarter similarity search.
*  Integrate with **LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, LLaMA via LangChain)** to enable query-based article retrieval using natural language.
*  Package the app into a **Docker container** and deploy to the cloud for scalability.
